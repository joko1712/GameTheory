Allways deflect

WHY?:
Because I can never lose only draw.
        Against Cooperators: If I always defect and my opponent always cooperates, I will consistently get the best possible outcome.
        I "win" in the sense that I exploit my opponentâ€™s cooperation.

        Against Other Defectors: If both me and my opponent always defect, we both receive a lower payoff compared to mutual cooperation.
        This is generally not a loss, but it's not optimal either.

        Against Tit-for-Tat or Other Responsive Strategies: These strategies typically start by cooperating and then mimic my last move.
        If I always defect, a tit-for-tat opponent will defect after the first move, leading to an ongoing series of mutual defection,
        which, like the above, results in a suboptimal outcome for both players.

Considerations:
While always defecting ensures I never receive the lowest possible outcome, it often prevents achieving higher payoffs available through cooperation.
This strategy might work effectively against consistently cooperative strategies but likely won't maximize my score in a round-robin tournament where
diverse strategies are employed.


Tit-for-Tat (TFT)
Begin by cooperating, then replicate the opponent's last move. This strategy is forgiving and can encourage cooperation but also protects against
consistent defection.

WHY:
        TFT is robust and often performs well in round-robin tournaments. It promotes mutual cooperation but swiftly retaliates against defection,
        discouraging opponents from continuing to defect.


Considerations:
Adjusting the initial moves based on tournament dynamics or introduce forgiveness to handle occasional defections without escalating to mutual defection
improves preformance.


Pavlov (Win-Stay, Lose-Shift)
Cooperate if both players made the same choice in the previous round (whether C or D), and switch if the choices differed. This strategy aligns with the
idea of repeating choices that have been successful.

WHY:
        It can quickly adapt to exploit consistent cooperators and also defends well against defectors.


ConsiderationS:
It may oscillate in response patterns if faced with similar strategies.


Randomized Strategies
Introduce a degree of randomness where the choice to cooperate or defect is probabilistic, influenced by past interactions.

WHY:
        Adds unpredictability to your play, making it harder for opponents to exploit a fixed strategy.

ConsiderationS:
Requires careful tuning of probabilities based on the tournament's progression and opponents' behaviors.
